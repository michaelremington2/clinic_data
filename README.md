The goal of this repository is to analyze clinical data on arthritus to see, on average, when patients will experience the most amount of inflamation bouts along a treatment cycle of 40 days. 720 patients were analyzed in this experiment and the data shows that inflamation bouts occur most frequently around 20 days into the trial with about 11 bouts on average.
